# No ops

While it's fun hacking on infrastructure, we strive to focus our resources on our product and providing value to our customers.

Time spend spinning up servers, tweaking network settings or patching security vulnerabilities is time taken from our main effort.

## Goals

1. **Focus on our product** and not the infrastructure running it.
2. An infrastructure that **scales without needing to do anything** about it.
3. **Happier lives**, with reduced incident alerts of servers going down, traffic spikes and security issues.

## How?

Choosing managed solutions is usually the best option: reduce operation costs, tweaked for performance and security/scaling/incidents are handled by the vendor.

Managed solutions include:

* CircleCI for Continuous integration and deployment
* AWS RDS for databases
* AWS Gateway & Lambda for running API servers
* AWS Lambda for running background jobs
