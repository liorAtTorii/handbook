# Coding Style

## Standard

Coding style tends to be hard to agree on and leads to a lot of bikeshedding. We decided to outsource our decisions to the [standard](https://standardjs.com/) JS coding style. It has nothing standard but its name, but it aligns everyone on the same coding style.

It is used as a plugin to your favorite IDE (vi, WebStorm, vscode) and runs on every commit via a git-commit hook.

Hopefully, code reviews will never be about coding style, but making the code simple and robust.
