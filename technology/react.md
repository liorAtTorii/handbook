# React

## Why React?

We chose React for its *component* based API, vibrant *community* and its *ubiquitous* nature.

*Components* allow for simple testing, code re-use and splitting tasks.

The *React community* has implemented components for almost any need.

React can be used for web applications development, native mobile development, email templates, browser extensions and more.

## Use with Redux

Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. This means we can rely on it to deliver consistent experience for our customer.

While Redux has a lot of boilerplate code, it is predictable and two developers will usually produce the same Redux code for the same task.
