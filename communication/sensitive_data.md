# Sensitive Data

Our customers trust us to protect their data and it's our top priority to do so.

From time to time there is a need to see customer data in order to fix bugs or work on new issues. Other sensitive data may include passwords, secret API keys, etc.

## What not to do

Do not share any sensitive information on third party communication tools such as Slack / JIRA / Trello / AirTable / etc...

## How to transfer sensitive data

There are a few ways to transfer data securely:

1. Use physical drives such as a USB drive
2. Use peer to peer software (Apple's AirDrop, sharedrop.io)
3. Use a password manager to share passwords / keys
